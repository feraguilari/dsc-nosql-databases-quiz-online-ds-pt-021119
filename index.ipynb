    "# NoSQL Databases - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n",
    "SQl uses structured query language for defining and manipulating data, while NoSQL has dynamic schema for unstructured data, and data is stored in many ways: it can be column-oriented, document-oriented, graph-based or organized as a KeyValue store.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Teh fitess depends on the kind of data that is going to be stored in the database. SQl is better for is a good choice for data with a predefined structure and set schemas. NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema that is much better suited for big data as flexibility is an important requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n",
    "A database for content management sites is a good example where NoSQL would perform better than SQL since it may be requiered to store documents with different properties, users, interactions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How does MongoDB work? How is it different from a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n",
    "In MongoDB, the data objects are stored as separate documents inside a collection â€” instead of storing the data into the columns and rows of a traditional relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n",
    "Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of (or one or more faults within) some of its components. Resilient Distributed Databases are stored in different servers with backups in other servers, so if a server is to fail, the backup kicks in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n",
    "Queries are performed simultaneously in each of the servers containing the data and then aggregated in th emain server to deliver a final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we reviewed some common NoSQL interview questions. "
